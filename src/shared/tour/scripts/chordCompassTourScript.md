## Script Refinements
### Goal

- Let's refine the workflow. The intro modal needs to not introduce Scale Sage but rather Chord Compass. The Scale Sage icon will be there as a kind of guide that people will recognize anyways. Let's talk about "Welcome to Chord Compass, a tool that will help you find chords on on the fretboard."

Welcome Modal, quickly show the three main components and mention that each one will get more detail, but for now:
1. The chord card - where you'll see notes being placed, but you can also select from all of your potential chords. 
2. The fretboard - where you can interact with and chords will be placed on the fretboard. 
3. The control panel - additional ways that you can interact with the fretboard. 

Then we go back to the fretboard to enter free play mode and show detection. Use the same workflow of placing a note and giving the user confirmation, like "Woah, are you a wizard?" When they place a second note, ideally the chord detection icon will show up. We want the user to interact with that and explain that, because they've selected a certain amount of notes, the detection system is a couple of chords that can work with them. 

The user will need to select a chord to progress, at which point it will go back to the fretboard in order to show how the chord has been placed. Show that the Play Chord button is available and they can hear what they've just placed on the fretboard. Encouraging message once done, like "Wow, that sounds great." 

Then we'll go back to the chord card to illustrate how it's been updated to show what's on the fretboard. Then we'll get the user to open the chord card and select a different chord. 

Once the chord is placed, we'll head back down and highlight the entire control panel and show how they can progress through the different positions that show the arrangement of notes on the fretboard. 

Then show the intervals where the user can change from the notes to the intervals or relationships between the notes. 

Then we want to show how a key can be selected, and then going back to the chord card to illustrate how it's now filtered down to only chords that belong to that key. Super helpful for whenever you're trying to work on a song and find variations, or you're trying to impress Griselda the witch with a fancy new chord.  This is going to be a point where we inject humor, and the AcceptModal will say something like: "Wait, what?" He'll then go down to the tuning and say, "If you're feeling extra fancy, you can select from a list of tunings or customize your own." There will be options to maintain the fingering or adapt it to the new tuning. This is helpful if you're trying to explore new tunings and find how chords work within them. 

Then we'll highlight the share button, demonstrating that when anything is on the fretboard, it can be shared as a link to someone, and they can load exactly what they're seeing on the screen. Great for sharing a new chord with your bandmate. 

Lastly, the clear all button will clear the fretboard, and that should wrap up the tour.
